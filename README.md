## Overview

“Rituals” is a task library for [Invoke](http://www.pyinvoke.org/) that keeps the
most common tasks you always need out of your project, and makes them centrally maintained.
This leaves your `tasks.py` small and to the point,
with only things specific to the project at hand.
The following lists the common task implementations that the ``rituals.easy`` module offers.
See the [full docs](https://rituals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#adding-rituals-to-your-project)
on how to integrate them into your `tasks.py`.

* ``help`` –    Default task, when invoked with no task names.
* ``clean`` –   Perform house-cleaning.
* ``build`` –   Build the project.
* ``test`` –    Perform standard unittests.
* ``check`` –   Perform source code checks.
* ``release.bump`` – Bump a development version.
* ``release.dist`` – Distribute the project.
* ``release.prep`` – Prepare for a release (perform QA checks, and switch to non-dev versioning).
* … and *many* more, see `inv -l` for a complete list.

The guiding principle for these tasks is to strictly separate
low-level tasks for building and installing (via ``setup.py``)
from high-level convenience tasks a developer uses (via ``invoke``).
Invoke tasks can use Setuptools ones as building blocks,
but never the other way 'round
– this avoids any bootstrapping headaches during package installations.

Use ``inv -h ‹task›`` as usual to get details on the options of these tasks.
Look at the modules in [acts](https://github.com/jhermann/rituals/blob/master/src/rituals/acts)
if you want to know what these tasks do exactly.
Also consult the [full documentation](https://rituals.readthedocs.io/)
for a complete reference.

:bulb: | The easiest way to get a working project using `rituals` is the [py-generic-project](https://github.com/Springerle/py-generic-project) cookiecutter archetype. That way you have a working project skeleton within minutes that is fully equipped, with all aspects of building, testing, quality checks, continuous integration, documentation, and releasing covered.

## Some Practical Examples

The following table shows a selection of typical use-cases and how to
carry them out in projects that include *Rituals* in their `tasks.py`
(e.g. this one).

Command | Description
----: | :----
`inv docs -w -b` | Start a `sphinx-autobuild` watchdog and open the resulting live-reload preview in your browser.
`inv test.tox --clean -e py34` | Run `tox` for Python 3.4 with a clean status, i.e. an empty `.tox` directory.
`inv release.bump` | Set the `tag_build` value in `setup.cfg` to something like `0.3.0.dev117+0.2.0.g993edd3.20150408t1747`, uniquely identifying dev builds, even in dirty working directories.

See the [full documentation](https://rituals.readthedocs.io/)
for more examples and a complete reference.


## Contributing

To create a working directory for this project, call these commands:

```sh
git clone "https://github.com/jhermann/rituals.git"
cd rituals
command . .env --yes --develop  # add '--virtualenv /usr/bin/virtualenv' for Python2
invoke build --docs test check
```

To use the source in this working directory within another project,
change your current directory to _this_ project,
then call `bin/pip` from *that* project's virtualenv like so:

    …/.venv/…/bin/pip install -e .

See [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/jhermann/rituals/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more.

## Releasing

This is the process of releasing  ``rituals`` itself,
projects that use it will have an identical to very similar sequence of commands.

```sh
inv release.prep
inv release.dist --devpi # local release + tox testing

git push && git push --tags # … and wait for Travis CI to do its thing

twine upload -r pypi dist/*
```

If you have any pending changes, staged or unstaged, you'll get an error like this:
