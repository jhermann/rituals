    Common tasks for 'Invoke' that are needed again and again.

    The ``rituals`` package provides PyInvoke tasks that work for any
    project, based on its project metadata, to automate common
    developer chores like 'clean', 'build', 'dist', 'test', 'check',
    and 'release-prep' (for the moment).

    The guiding principle for these tasks is to strictly separate
    low-level tasks for building and installing (via ``setup.py``) from
    high-level convenience tasks a developer uses (via ``tasks.py``).
    Invoke tasks can use Setuptools ones as building blocks, but
    never the other way 'round – this avoids bootstrapping head-
    aches during package installations using ``pip``.

    The easiest way to get a working project based on ``rituals`` is
    the ``py-generic-project`` cookiecutter template. That way you have
    a working project skeleton within minutes that is fully equipped,
    with all aspects of bootstrapping, building, testing, quality
    checks, continuous integration, documentation, and releasing
    covered. See here for more:
